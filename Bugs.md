enemy ai improvement should priorise opening chests first and then attacking but not only targeting player, also attacking other AIs
Entities cant spawn in houses because they cant escape them
storm is shrinking significantly faster
every player spawns at different locations not overlaping
minimap doesnt show the map 
weapons shouldnt one shot they should have a cap to their damage
improve the ammo shot out so that it doesnt just disappear at the same spot make it cleaner
Bushes make enemy players invisible
